# Gemini API Policy Compliance - Appeal Documentation

## Executive Summary
BongBariComedy.com is a family-friendly Bengali comedy platform that uses Google's Gemini API responsibly for an AI chatbot feature. This document outlines our comprehensive security measures and policy compliance implementation.

## üîê Security Implementation

### 1. API Key Protection ‚úÖ

- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/prod configurations with proper access controls
- **Graceful Fallback**: System operates safely when API key is unavailable

### 2. Content Moderation System ‚úÖ
**Input Filtering (`server/moderation.ts`):**
- Prohibited content detection (adult, harmful, hate speech, personal info)
- Length limits (max 5000 characters) to prevent abuse

- Family-friendly content promotion
