# MANUAL STEPS BEFORE TOMORROW'S DEVELOPMENT

## âœ… COMPLETED CLEANUP
- âœ… Removed all Netlify function calls from components
- âœ… Deleted netlify.toml configuration file
- âœ… Removed @netlify/blobs dependency from package.json
- âœ… Cleaned up Netlify scripts from package.json
- âœ… Updated .env.example with correct domain references
- âœ… Built and deployed clean frontend to GitHub Pages
- âœ… Verified Neon database connection (all 11 tables exist)
- âœ… Pushed backend changes to Render

## ðŸŽ¯ MANUAL TESTS TO RUN NOW

### 1. Test Live Website (5 minutes)
**Visit each URL and check functionality:**
- [ ] Main site: https://www.bongbari.com *(should load homepage)*
- [ ] Login: https://www.bongbari.com/login *(should load login page, not 404)*
- [ ] Community: https://www.bongbari.com/community-feed *(should show posts)*
- [ ] Stories: https://www.bongbari.com/stories *(should show story submission)*

### 2. Check Browser Developer Tools (2 minutes)
**Open browser dev tools (F12) on www.bongbari.com:**
- [ ] Network tab: Look for API calls to `bongbaricomedy.onrender.com`
- [ ] Console tab: Check for any red errors (CORS, 404s, etc.)
- [ ] Should see API calls working, no Netlify references

### 3. Test Key Features (3 minutes)
**On the live site:**
- [ ] Try logging in (if you have credentials)
- [ ] Submit a test story
- [ ] Check if promotional marquee shows up
- [ ] Browse community posts if any exist

## ðŸš¨ WHAT TO DO IF SOMETHING FAILS

### If login page shows 404:
- Wait 5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check CNAME file exists in gh-pages branch

### If API calls fail:
- Check Render backend status at render.com dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set in Render
- Check if backend is sleeping (first API call takes 30s to wake up)

### If no data loads:
- Database is working (we tested it)
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- API might be slow on first load (Render free tier sleeps)

## ðŸ“‹ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

**Mark each as complete after testing:**
- [ ] âœ… Website loads at www.bongbari.com
- [ ] âœ… SPA routing works (direct URL access)
- [ ] âœ… API calls reach Render backend
- [ ] âœ… No console errors in browser
- [ ] âœ… Database connection confirmed
- [ ] âœ… No Netlify references anywhere

## ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP

**For tomorrow's coding session:**
```bash
# Start both servers locally
npm run dev:live

# Or start them separately:
npm run dev:server:esm  # Terminal 1
npm run client          # Terminal 2
```

**Architecture is now:**
- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages (www.bongbari.com) âœ…
- **Backend**: Render (bongbaricomedy.onrender.com) âœ…  
- **Database**: Neon Postgres âœ…
- **Domain**: Hostinger DNS â†’ GitHub Pages âœ…

2. **Complete Feature Migration**
   - Migrate meme service to Postgres
   - Seed blog posts into database

3. **Performance Optimization**
