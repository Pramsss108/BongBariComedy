General Layout

The header should be a slim, fixed top bar exactly like Flaticon’s header (no extra vertical padding above or below).

No white space before or after the header. The header should sit flush at the very top of the viewport, occupying the full width.

Color Scheme (Bong Bari brand)

Background color: #0D47FF (Bong Bari blue).

Text and menu items: white (#FFFFFF).

Active/hover link: Bong Bari yellow (#FFD200).

Logo Section

On the left, place the Bong Bari logo (use the provided logo image file).

Next to the logo, place the brand name in Bengali: বং বাড়ি

Below the brand name, add the tagline in English and Bengali:

English: “Every Home’s Story”

Bengali: “প্রতিটা বাড়ির গল্প”

Align logo and text vertically centered.

Navigation Menu

On the right side of the header, include the following menu items in a single row:

Home

About

Work with us

Contact

Blog

Login (with login icon in front, same as in the screenshot you saw)

Menu items should be horizontally aligned and have equal spacing.

No extra gaps between header and menu.

Header Styling

Height: not more than 60px (keep it slim like Flaticon).

Use flexbox with justify-content: space-between for proper alignment.

Font family: sans-serif, medium weight.

No box-shadow, no border, no extra margins.

Below the Header (Promotional Section)

Immediately below the header (with no white gap in between), add a full-width section with Bong Bari background color (#FFD200).

Inside this section, place a search bar or text area for promotion/offers.

Center align horizontally and vertically inside the section.

No white margin before or after this section.

Responsiveness

On desktop: menu items spread across the top bar.

On mobile: collapse into a hamburger menu (on the right side).

Logo and brand name should shrink proportionally, keeping everything slim.

Important Instructions

Do not add any white margin, padding, or background above the header or below the promotional section.

Header and promotional section should look like they are stitched together with no gaps.

The design must visually replicate Flaticon’s slim header style but with Bong Bari’s colors and branding.
